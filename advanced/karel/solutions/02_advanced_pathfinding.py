"""
Karel is getting tired of being lost all the time. Therefore, it want's to learn how to find and remember the shortest 
way through a maze.

Help Karel to find the shortest way through the labyrinth and mark it with beepers. For testing purposes, 
a smaller labyrinth map has been created for this task. However, once you're done, this solution should also work
on the big labyrinth from task 01_another_labyrinth. 

Hint: Placing multiple beepers and counting them might be necessary...
