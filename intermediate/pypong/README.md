# Pypong

**Author:** [theCalcaholic][1]

## Description

Program the classic video game Pong in python. You start with an empty canvas that and a prepared game loop.

### Concepts you should be familiar with:

- variables
- types
- functions

## Setup

### Linux

Install the package python3-tk. For example, on Ubuntu: 
```sh
apt install python3-tk
```

### Windows

*Nothing to do*

**All challenges require the [essentials][2] to be set up!**

## Run

```sh
python3 main.py
```

## Task

Program the game pong in python. You are provided with an empty canvas, that you can draw objects on,
a `game_loop` function that will be called every game tick and a `key_down` function that is called,
whenever a player presses a button on the keyboard.

Your end result should look roughly like this:

**Hints**:
- You only need to edit the file [pong/core.py][3]. Don't touch anything else ;)
- Within this file you will find further instructions and examples for a few useful commands
- You'll probably not need any code outside of the predefined functions, except maybe for variable declarations
