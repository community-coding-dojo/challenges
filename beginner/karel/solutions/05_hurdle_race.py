"""
Time for some sportive activity! Karel is doing a hurdle race. Help it, to jump the hurdles.

Now, you >could< write this solutions's main function by manually filling in all the individual steps Karel is going to
perform - but that wouldn't be any fun.
Instead, try to use if conditions and while loops in order to reduce the code you need to write to a minimum.

You can also define extra functions for structuring your code.

Keep in mind: Karel needs to touch the "ground" after each hurdle before jumping the next one.
