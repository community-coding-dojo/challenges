Karel wants to play chess with its friend, Coral. Help it to prepare the chess board by making it put beepers at the
right places.

If you've done everything right, you should be able to use your program for both 04_chessboard.w and 04_chessboard_2.w
- try it out (you can load another map by clicking on "Load World" in the Karel application).
