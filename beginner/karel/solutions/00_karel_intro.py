"""
Welcome to the world of Karel! Karel is a little robot that is assigned various tasks.
Your job is to give him clear instructions for resolving those ;)
For that purpose, you can use the commands, described in the main function below and then follow the instructions in
the Readme for running your solution.

In this task, Karel needs to move to the beeper (the green thingy), pick it up and return to its initial position

Good luck!
